#flutter Museum Quest wiht Real Time Object Detection

This way the Project from my First Hackathon with the Goal ot gamify a Museum.
My Team and I build a quest Game. There are quest you halve to solve nad if you believe you know the answer you sould point the Camers at the Object and it gets detected.

My Part Was to Build the App.

For Building the APP we used the tflite Plugin. 
We wanted to train our own Neural Network but this didn't work out, so we used an already trained Network used to Detect normlal Things like Laptops etc. for demonstrating purposes.
